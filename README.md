# üî• HTB Noxious ‚Äî Network Forensics & LLMNR Poisoning Analysis

## üß® The Problem  
An IDS alert was triggered by suspicious LLMNR traffic within Forela‚Äôs internal Active Directory VLAN. The alert pointed to possible `LLMNR Poisoning`, a technique used by attackers to capture NTLM hashes by impersonating the domain controller. The packet capture suggested rogue behavior targeting a victim machine. The objective was to validate the attack, identify the rogue device, extract the captured hash, and determine if the attack was successful in stealing credentials.

## üõ† Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Wireshark** | Packet analysis from `.pcap` file |
| **Hashcat** | Cracking NTLMv2 hash from captured NTLMSSP traffic |
| **LLMNR / SMB / DHCP Filters** | Isolating traffic types within Wireshark |
| **Responder (attacker-side)** | Referenced as tool likely used in the attack |

## üîç Method (Investigation Steps)

1. **Initial Setup and Packet Review**  
   - Extracted the `.pcap` from the `noxious.zip` archive.
   - Opened the PCAP in `Wireshark` and reviewed top IPs using `Statistics ‚Üí Endpoints`.

2. **LLMNR Traffic Analysis**  
   - Applied filter `udp.port == 5355` to isolate **LLMNR traffic**.
   - Determined the actual **Domain Controller IP** by filtering for `DNS` traffic and resolving `DC01` FQDN.
   - Found a rogue IP responding to an LLMNR query that should have gone to the domain controller, indicating spoofing.

3. **DHCP Inspection to Identify Hostname**  
   - Used filter `ip.addr == <rogue_ip> && dhcp` to discover the hostname assigned during DHCP negotiation.

4. **NTLM Hash Capture Verification**  
   - Applied the `ntlmssp` filter to inspect NTLM negotiation packets.
   - Identified the **user account** involved in the NTLM authentication initiated by the victim machine.

5. **Timeline Reconstruction**  
   - Switched time format to UTC in Wireshark and documented the timestamp of the first NTLM authentication sequence, aligning with the LLMNR spoof response.

6. **Captured Hash Extraction**  
   - Located the **NTLM Server Challenge** and **NTProofStr** from NTLMSSP packets.
   - Constructed the hash cracking input format using NTLMv2 details from the packet capture.

7. **Password Cracking with Hashcat**  
   - Used Hashcat with mode `-m 5600` to crack the NTLMv2 hash.
   - Confirmed that the attacker could have recovered the user‚Äôs password using wordlist-based cracking.

8. **Victim Behavior & Typo Detection**  
   - Analyzed the LLMNR and SMB traffic to understand the user‚Äôs mistake.
   - Discovered the victim typed a mistyped server name (`DCC01`) instead of `DC01`, triggering a fallback to LLMNR resolution.

9. **File Share Contextual Review**  
   - Reviewed `SMB2` traffic for tree connect events to uncover the actual file share the user attempted to access.

## ‚úÖ The Solution  
The investigation confirmed a successful `LLMNR Poisoning attack` using a rogue device masquerading as the domain controller. The attacker exploited a user‚Äôs typo when navigating to a file share (`DCC01`), triggering a fallback to LLMNR. The rogue machine intercepted the query, responded, and successfully captured the user's `NTLMv2 hash`, which was later proven crackable with `Hashcat`. This scenario highlights how small user errors in legacy protocol environments can lead to credential theft.
